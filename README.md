Automated Essay Scoring on The Hewlett Foundation dataset on Kaggle

Automated essay scoring (AES) is the use of specialized computer programs to assign grades to essays written in an educational setting.It is a form of educational assessment and an application of natural language processing. Its objective is to classify a large set of textual entities into a small number of discrete categories, corresponding to the possible grades, for example, the numbers 1 to 6. Therefore, it can be considered a problem of statistical classification. Automated essay scoring (AES), the task of employing com- puter technology to score written text, is one of the most im- portant educational applications of natural language process- ing (NLP). This area of research began with Pageâ€™s [1966] pioneering work on the Project Essay Grader system and has remained active since then. The vast majority of work on AES has focused on holistic scoring, which summarizes the quality of an essay with a single score. There are at least two reasons for this focus. First, corpora manually annotated with holistic scores are publicly available, facilitating the de- velopment of learning-based holistic scoring engines. Sec- ond, holistic scoring technologies are commercially valuable: being able to automate the scoring of the millions of essays written for standardized aptitude tests such as the SAT and the GRE every year can save a lot of manual grading effort
